# MONTY PROJECT TEST CASE SUITE

## OVERVIEW

Each folder represents each task to check your source code. Copy your compiled C binary into the directory/task you would like to test, then run the specific bash file to see if you are passing that specific test condition.

## HOW TO USE

- Clone the repo [alx_test_suite](https://github.com/Fuzzworth/alx_test_suite.git)
```
git clone https://github.com/Fuzzworth/alx_test_suite.git

cd alx_test_suite/monty_project
```

- Copy the source file into the directory/task folder you want to test for in the monty_project directory
```
cp <path/to/monty/binary> task_XX/.
```

- run the test 
```
./<specific_test>.sh
```
